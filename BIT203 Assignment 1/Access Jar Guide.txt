Access Jar Guide

Since I'm using Visual Studio Code IDE (Blue Colored Icon), Here is the guide on how to run the jar file:
- First, download the extension pack for Java.
  NOTE: Search for "Extension Pack for Java" that's powered by microsoft.
- Once it's done, run the jar file by entering the following command:

<file directory>/ java -jar bit203assignment1.jar
